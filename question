# 🤖 ML Assignment - Supervised Regression

## 📝 Problem Statement
Using Deep Learning techniques, predict the coordinates `(x, y)` of a single pixel which has a value of `255` in a given `50x50` pixel grayscale image (where all other pixels are `0`). 

* **Dataset:** You may generate a dataset as required for solving the problem. 
* **Requirement:** Please explain your rationale behind your dataset choices.

## 📤 Submission Guidelines
* **Code & Visualization:** Share your code in a notebook with train logs and graphs showing ground truth and predicted coordinates. Show any result you might find useful.
* **Setup:** Include any necessary dependencies and installation instructions.
* **Code Quality:** Ensure the code follows **PEP8** standards and includes comments where necessary.
* **Format:** Submit the assignment via a Git repository or a compressed file.
